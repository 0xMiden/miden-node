Welcome to the developer guide for the `miden` node :)

> [!TIP]
> This is intended to serve as a basic introduction to the codebase as well as covering relevant concepts and
> recording architectural decisions.
>
> This is _not_ intended for dApp developers or users of the node, but for development on this codebase itself.

> [!CAUTION]
> Living documents go stale - the code is the final arbitrator of truth.

It is also a good idea to familiarise yourself with the [operator manual](../operator.md).
